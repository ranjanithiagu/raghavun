# About {.unnumbered}

This is a book that traces the journey of Raghavun, now an autistic adult, over a period of $35$â€‹ years. It is divided into fourteen chapters and is best read sequentially. I hope this book would be of use to parents of autistic children. It might also be useful for the general reader to get an idea of what it means to live with an autistic child.
