# Bright Future {.unnumbered}

<hr>

We will certainly face criticism from our family for focusing too much on our child to the extent of ignoring other people and things. Nothing can be done to change this perception. All criticisms arise because people have difficulty in understanding. So never mind. What I am going to say may sound a bit philosophical but it is true. Actually these children mould us, help us become a better version of ourselves. We become better human beings in the process of helping them. If we just pause to think, we will realise:

- How very important it is to always have a positive attitude in life.
- The futility of attaching undue importance to trivial and trifling events in life.
- How eventful every single day and moment is.
- How to keep calm when nothing is in place.
- How to say no.
- How to remove negativity from life and much more.

Raghavun taught us the purpose of life. Even the best books with motivational essays and stories could not have given us these life lessons we had by just being with Raghavun. We learnt to be grateful for all the little blessings.

There are many videos available now on YouTube on autism. Mostly they talk about children who are able to learn to read and write. Do not get confused or feel guilty. Always remember that autism is a spectrum disorder and the spectrum is quite wide. Besides this, in countries such as the US and UK, they have better infrastructure and the normal schools accept these children. In India it is different. Do in Rome as Romans do. We should be settled and calm in the first place to pass it on to our children. Parents should keep a close watch on their child’s development and decide on the treatment and therapy. Who else will be more concerned about the child than parents? Once you decide, walk on the chosen path with confidence and faith.

Do not take wrong inputs and vibrations from people around you. At the same time, listen to the advice of caring people, good therapists and try to incorporate it in your daily routine if you feel it will work out. This book is about an Indian child living in an Indian family. Though human emotions are the same all over the globe, there are bound to be some minor differences in the way people from a different country or culture look at the same issue. And all the books I came across talk only about success stories. I want to stress this important truth which often gets overlooked: every one of us is successful in our own way. Whenever I see a young mother walking with an autistic child, my eyes well up. I relive those years when Raghavun was a baby. I wish all fathers of special children are as understanding and loving as Raghavun’s dad and it is a blessing to have a sibling like Karthik. Patience is the key word. With passing years, these children improve. Do not give up hope. Never get depressed. Teach at least one small thing every day. It will bring about major changes.

We come to the world with a mission. The moment we know our child is different, the mission of our lives reveals itself clearly to us. Yes. To make the child as independent a person as possible. We must strive to do our best to help the child lead an independent life when we won't be around. One of our aims should be to give as little problem to the siblings of the child or his caretaker in the future. Many people do great things, sacrifice many things for achieving greater goals. We must definitely do our bit at least for our child. Other preoccupations and interests should take a back seat automatically. We are not losing anything in this process. We are only shifting our interests.

Generally, women do this more easily than men. There are many changes in a woman’s life. A female child is treated differently when she attains puberty. She moves out of her parents’ place and goes to live with her husband. When she becomes a mother her responsibilities increase several folds suddenly. Women adapt to all these changes graciously. But it is difficult for men. With a few exceptions men are superficial in general. They are not to blame. They are created that way. It takes time for fathers to shift their interests. Some men don't understand. Sensitive men understand better but even they are not ready to leave behind all other interests for the sake of the child.

We too had problems. In recent years I felt there was an energy drain because Thiagu took his own time to get adjusted and I was in a hurry and in an excited state to include him into our world. Raghavun is thirty two now. When our child enters thirty all relatives and friends in our age group would have been done with the usual responsibilities such as getting their children married. Their children would have started their own independent lives. Let such things not bother us. We should be smoothly flowing along like a river. The river is a blessing to the people on its way. In a similar manner let us radiate happiness to the people around us. We shall do our best. We have felt it is worth going to the maximum extent possible to see a smile on Raghavun's face.

Let us remember to be grateful for even small things in life. When things are perfect we never ask why. However, even the slightest deviations from this state of perfection prompt us to ask "why me"? Let us never ask this question again and banish it from our minds. We shall always be grateful and peaceful. I will be happy if the information shared in this write-up helps someone, some family like ours. I will see you all soon with more positive anecdotes about Raghavun.
